1.
(The EvenNumber class) Define the EvenNumber class for representing an even
number. The class contains
A data field value of the int type that represents the integer value stored in the
object
A no-arg constructor that creates an EvenNumber object for the value o
A constructor that constructs an EvenNumber object with the specified value
A function named getValue() to return an int value for this object.
A function named getNext) to return an EvenNumber object that represents
the next even number after the current even number in this object.
- A function named getPrevious() to return an EvenNumber object that represents
the previous even number before the current even number in this object
Implement the class. Write a test program
that creates an EvenNumber object for value 16 and invokes the getNext) and
getPrevious() functions to obtain and displays these numbers.
2.
(The Stock class) Design a class named Stock that contains the following
A string data field named symbol for the stock's symbol.
A string data field named name for the stock's name
- A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock
price for the previous day
1 A double data field named currentPrico that stores the stock price for the
current time
A constructor that creates a stock with specified symbol and name.
The constant accessor functions for all data field
The mutator functions for previousClosingPrice and currentPrice
A constant function named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage
changed from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice
Implement the class. Write a test program
that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol MSFT, the name Microsoft Corporation
and the previous closing price of 27.5. Set a new current price to 27.6
and display the price-change percentage.
(The MyDate class) Design a class named MyDate. The class contains
3.
The data fields year, month, and day that represent a date. month is o-based
ie., 0 is for January
a A no-arg constructor that creates a MyDate object for the current date
A constructor that constructs a MyDate object with a specified elapsed time
since midnight, January 1, 1970, in seconds
. A constructor that constructs a MyDate object with the specified year, month,
and day.
Three constant get functions for the data fields year, month, and day,
respectively
Three set functions for the data fields year, month, and day, respectively.
