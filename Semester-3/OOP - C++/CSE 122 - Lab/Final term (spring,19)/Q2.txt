A function named setDate(long elapsedTime) that sets a new date for
the object using the elapsed time. implement the class. Write a test program that creates two MyDate
objects (using MyDate) andMyDate(3435555513)) and displays their year, month, and day
(Hint: The first two constructors will extract the year, month, and day from the
elapsed time. For example, if the elapsed time is 561555550 seconds, the year
is 1987, the month is 9, and the day is 18.)
4. (The MyPoint class) Design a class named MyPoint to represent a point with xand
y-coordinates. The class contains:
Two data fields x and y that represent the coordinates.
A no-arg constructor that creates a point (0, 0)
A constructor that constructs a point with specified coordinates
Two get functions for data fields x and y, respectively
A function named distance that returns the distance from this point to another
point of the MyPoint type. Implement the class. Write a test program
that creates two points (0, 0) and (10, 30.5) and displays the distance between
them.
5. Create an Account class to model a bank account.
An account has the properties account
number, balance, and annual profit rate, date created, and functions to deposit
and withdraw. Create two derived classes for checking and saving accounts.
A checking account has an overdraft limit, but a savings account cannot be overdrawn.
Define a constant virtual toString) function in the Account class and
override it in the derived classes to return the account number and balance as a
string. Write a test program that creates objects of Account, SavingsAccount, and CheckingAccount
andinvokes their toString) functions.
