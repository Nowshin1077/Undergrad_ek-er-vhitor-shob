1) Plan driven process- Everything is pre-planned and fixed


The methodology we are using for our system is
*** Agile- Agile is an alternative to Waterfall or traditional
sequential development.
Agile is a structured and iterative approach of project management and 
product development. 
For agile process project management methodologies 
(Scrum, Kanban, XP, and others) can be use.

Scrum- SCRUM is the most widely preferred agile software development approach.
Basically, this excellent development is suitable for those development projects 
that are constantly altering
Decision making lies in the hands of the team. 



In short, Agile is a time-focused philosophy that allows creating a project incrementally, 
dividing it into small pieces. One of its main benefits is the ability to adapt and change 
at any step.


Drawbacks:
==========
Agile mothodology cann't be use for big or huge projects.

For this methodology customer is the first priority so project development will be as per customers requirments.


2) The Waterfall Model: Plan driven model (phases are specified )
There are several steps in waterfall model

1) Name of their system 
2) Works happend on that system.
3) Method used.
4) Output/Accuracy percentage.  
5) Limitations of the system. 
6) Add refearence(do citation).

Formal Notice:
1)Mention the title,
2)project methodology (tools and technology), 
3)outcome, 
4)drawbacks, and 
5)further scopes for the existing system.
